Data Leakage when good performance on training or validation but bad on real production.
There are two main types of leakage: target leakage and train-test contamination.

1) Target leakage
When your predictors include data that will not be available at the time you make predictions.
It is important to think about target leakage in terms of the timing or chronological order
--> We have to check the chronological order for a feature that explains well the target. Ex: having a disease (y) and take medication
Solution: not use the features that are available after the prediction time --> drop

2) Train-test contamination
When training data using validation set. That's why we need to SPLIT THE DATA BEFORE PREPROCESSING.
Learn preprocessing on train (fit) and apply on the validation and test sets (transform)
